        <li>Are pleasing to the eye.</li>
        <li>Incorporate cutting edge technologies.</li>
        <li>Blur the line between science and art.</li>
        <li>Create meaningful user experiences.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>About Christopher</h2>
      <p>I've always had a passion for the technological. In highschool I completed <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/">Linux From Scratch</a> to more intimately understand the innerworkings of operating systems. In college I took C++ and Python courses and excelled at them. Even though my life took a different path where I racked up ten years of work and leadership experience in the retail and grocery sectors, I've recently begun work to transition into the tech sector.</p>
      <p>I enrolled in Thinkful on June 1st, 2022 and have begun my journey to become a software developer!</p>
      <p>If you are looking to hire someone that views coding and technology as more than just an occupation, or are looking to team up on an awesome project drop me a line! I'm so excited to connect with like minded people!</p>
